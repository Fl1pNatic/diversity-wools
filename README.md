# diversity-wools
Datapack for "Diversity" map wool collecting system.

This datapack needs editing for your world. 
Go to data/fl1p/functions and edit all the files there and correct their coordinates. So it will be working for you. 
You need to have chest for this to work.
# How to use:
1.Have a chest or a hopper that will be filled with wools. \n
2.On the first line correct coordinates and block if needed(if it's not chest) \n
3.On the second line correct coordinates and block again and correct coordinates for placing redstone wire \n
4.On the third line correct coordinates and block once again(if needed) \n
5.In "diversity_final.mcfunction" change commands to run. \n
# If you need additional colors:
Make another file (eg. diversity_white.mcfunction) \n
Copy and paste commands from any of the files(except for diversity_final) \n
Edit colors and text. (eg. instead of red_wool, change it to white_wool) \n

# How to install:
Go to your world's folder. (press win + r, type %appdata%, go to .minecraft/saves, and you will find your world name)
Copy the folder in Datapacks folder in your world's folder.
When you need to execute checking for wool - type /function(without slash in command block) fl1p:diversity_wool. (eg. /function fl1p:diversity_lime)
