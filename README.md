# diversity-wools
Datapack for "Diversity" map wool collecting system.

This datapack needs editing for your world. 
Go to data/fl1p/functions and edit all the files there and correct their coordinates. So it will be working for you. 
You need to have chest for this to work.
# How to use:
1.Have a chest or a hopper that will be filled with wools. <br>
2.On the first line correct coordinates and block if needed(if it's not chest) <br>
3.On the second line correct coordinates and block again and correct coordinates for placing redstone wire <br>
4.On the third line correct coordinates and block once again(if needed) <br>
5.In "diversity_final.mcfunction" change commands to run. <br>
# If you need additional colors:
Make another file (eg. diversity_white.mcfunction) <br>
Copy and paste commands from any of the files(except for diversity_final) <br>
Edit colors and text. (eg. instead of red_wool, change it to white_wool) <br>

# How to install:
Go to your world's folder. (press win + r, type %appdata%, go to .minecraft/saves, and you will find your world name)<br>
Copy the folder in Datapacks folder in your world's folder.<br>
When you need to execute checking for wool - type /function(without slash in command block) fl1p:diversity_wool. (eg. /function fl1p:diversity_lime)
